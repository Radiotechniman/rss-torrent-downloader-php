Torrent/Tracker Library
A basic library for getting information about BitTorrent .torrent files and trackers from within PHP.

Intro:

  This library is free for public use and redistribution, but I'd appreciate being notified if you
  decide to use it in your work. If you make any changes to the library feel free to send them to me
  to include in my code.

  Please Note: This script will not be able to scrape trackers unless allow_url_fopen is set to true and
  so may not function on some public/shared servers.

Usage:

  A straight-forward example of opening a torrent and querying a tracker can be found in "example.php".
  You will require at least some familiarity with PHP syntax and perhaps some basic object oriented programming
  knowledge in order to understand the example. If you do not understand any part of the example, feel free
  to contact me for assistance. If there is enough demand for it, I will summarise the scripts functionality
  in a manual.
  
  All the scripts necessary for the operation of the library are included in the "lib" folder.

More Information:

  A full documentation of the functions and classes of the library is provided in Manual.pdf.
